# Efforce NFT | WOZX Locking Functionality

Locking WOZX tokens is required in order to be able to contribute to Energy Efficiency Projects. A number of tokens equal to 10% to 20% of the cost of implementation will be locked for the whole duration of the project. You can lock your tokens [on the project page of Efforce DApp](https://app.efforce.io/projects).

## Organization

2. [`ProjectsManagerContract/`] Contract to manage the locking/withdraw of WOZX
